### Step 1: Determine Gross and Net Income
- **Gross Income**: $814
- **Net Income**: $333

### Step 2: Apply Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 1-2, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $622 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $944.
   - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of $333 = $166.5.
   - Excess shelter costs = $944 - $166.5 = $777.5.
   - Since this amount exceeds the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we will use $597 for the deduction.

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
  - Gross Income: $814
  - Deductions: 
    - Standard Deduction: $177
    - Excess Shelter Deduction: $597
  - Total Deductions: $177 + $597 = $774
  - Net Monthly Income: $814 - $774 = $40

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size of 1**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
  - 30% of $40 = $12
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
  - Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $250 - $12 = $238

### Step 5: Resource Limits
- The household has total assets of $0 and liquid assets of $7. The resource limit for households with at least one member who is disabled is $3,750, so the household is below the resource limit.

### Final Calculation
- The final calculated benefit for this household is:

1. **Household Information**:
   - Household Size: 1
   - Age: 1 person over 60
   - Disability: 0
   - Categorical Eligibility: No (not receiving TANF)
   - Homeless: Yes
   - Total Gross Income: $0
   - Total Net Income: $0

2. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the gross income is $0, the earned income deduction is also $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
   - **Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
     - Total Shelter Costs: $322 (includes rent and utilities).
     - Since the household is homeless, they qualify for the homeless shelter deduction of $159.73.
     - The household's net income after deductions is $0, so we will not apply the excess shelter deduction as it is based on net income.

3. **Calculating Net Monthly Income**:
   - Net Income = Gross Income - Deductions
   - Net Income = $0 - ($177 standard deduction + $0 earned income deduction + $0 dependent care + $0 child support + $159.73 homeless shelter deduction)
   - Net Income = $0 - $177 = -$177 (but net income cannot be negative, so it remains $0).

4. **Calculating SNAP Benefits**:
   - Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person: $250.
   - 30% of Net Income: 30% of $0 = $0.
   - SNAP Allotment = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income
   - SNAP Allotment = $250 - $0 = $250.

5. **Final Calculated Benefit**:
   - The final calculated benefit for this household is: {Final Calculated Benefit: $250}.","1 individual(s) listed in this SNAP application.

### Step 1: Determine Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Gross earned income: $0
   - Deduction: $0 (20% of $0)

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - Household size: 1
   - Standard deduction for household size 1: $177

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported)

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no child support reported)

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs: $608 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $930
   - Net income after deductions: $1117
   - 50% of net income: $1117 / 2 = $558.5
   - Excess shelter costs: $930 - $558.5 = $371.5 (this amount can be deducted)
   - Since the excess shelter costs are less than the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we can deduct the full amount of $371.5.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
   - Gross income: $1327
   - Total deductions: $0 (earned income) + $177 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $371.5 (excess shelter) = $548.5
   - Net monthly income: $1327 - $548.5 = $778.5

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size**:
   - Household size: 1
   - Maximum monthly allotment: $250

- **30% of Net Monthly Income**:
   - 30% of $778.5 = $233.55

- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
   - SNAP benefit = Maximum allotment - 30% of net income
   - SNAP benefit = $250 - $233.55 = $16.45
   - Since benefits are rounded down to the nearest dollar, the final calculated benefit is $16.

### Step 4: Resource Limits
- The household is not categorically eligible, and since the total assets are $0, they fall below the resource limit of $2,500 for households without a member who is age 60 or older or disabled.

### Final Calculation
- The final calculated benefit for this household is:

1. **Gross Monthly Income**: $1,695
2. **Net Monthly Income**: $1,518

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 3, the standard deduction is $177 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $507 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $829.
  - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of $1,518 = $759.
  - Excess shelter costs = $829 - $759 = $70 (this amount can be deducted).

### Total Deductions
- Total deductions = 20% Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction + Dependent Care Deduction + Legally Owed Child Support + Excess Shelter Costs
- Total deductions = $0 + $177 + $0 + $0 + $70 = $247.

### Net Monthly Income Calculation
- Net Monthly Income after deductions = Net Monthly Income - Total Deductions
- Net Monthly Income after deductions = $1,518 - $247 = $1,271.

### SNAP Benefit Calculation
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for a household of 3 = $658.
- 30% of the household's net monthly income = 30% of $1,271 = $381.30.
- SNAP benefit = Maximum Monthly Allotment - 30% of Net Monthly Income
- SNAP benefit = $658 - $381.30 = $276.70.

Since SNAP benefits are rounded down to the nearest whole dollar, the final calculated benefit is:

1. **Household Composition**: 
   - 1 individual in the household.
   - No one over 60 or with a disability.
   - Not categorically eligible through TANF.

2. **Income**:
   - Gross Income: $2,762
   - Net Income: $2,033

3. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
     - 20% of $2,762 = $552.40
   - **Standard Deduction**: 
     - For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - **Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Medical Expenses**: $0 (no medical expenses since no one is over 60 or has a disability).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: $0 (no shelter costs).

4. **Calculating Net Monthly Income**:
   - Gross Income: $2,762
   - Total Deductions: $552.40 (earned income deduction) + $178 (standard deduction) = $730.40
   - Net Monthly Income: $2,762 - $730.40 = $2,031.60

5. **Calculating SNAP Benefits**:
   - Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person: $250.
   - 30% of Net Monthly Income: 30% of $2,031.60 = $609.48
   - SNAP Allotment: $250 - $609.48 = Negative value, which means the household is not eligible for benefits.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - Since the calculated SNAP allotment is negative, the household is not eligible for SNAP benefits.

6. **Child Support Payments**: $0
7. **Utilities**: $0
8. **Assets**: $0 (no resource limit applies since the household is homeless and not categorically eligible)

### Deductions:
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the gross income is $0, the deduction is also $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $193 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (not applicable).
- **Child Support Deduction**: $0 (not applicable).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: Since there are no shelter costs, this deduction is $0.

### Calculation of Net Monthly Income:
Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - Deductions
- Deductions = 20% of $0 + Standard Deduction ($193) + Dependent Care ($0) + Child Support ($0) + Excess Shelter Costs ($0) = $0 + $193 + $0 + $0 + $0 = $193

Net Monthly Income = $0 - $193 = -$193 (Since net income cannot be negative, it is considered $0 for SNAP calculations).

### SNAP Allotment Calculation:
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 Person**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 30% of $0 = $0

### Final SNAP Benefit Calculation:
Final SNAP Benefit = Maximum Monthly Allotment - 30% of Net Monthly Income
Final SNAP Benefit = $250 - $0 = $250

2. **Categorical Eligibility**: The household is categorically eligible through TANF.
3. **Gross Monthly Income**: $855
4. **Net Monthly Income**: $593

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 5, the standard deduction is $215.
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $367 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $689.
  - 50% of net income = 50% of $593 = $296.5.
  - Excess shelter costs = $689 - $296.5 = $392.5.
  - Since this exceeds the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we will use the maximum shelter deduction of $597.

### Net Income Calculation
Net Income = Gross Income - Deductions
- Total deductions = 0 (earned income) + $215 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $597 (shelter deduction) = $812.
- Net Income = $855 - $812 = $43.

### Step 1: Determine Gross Monthly Income
- Gross Monthly Income: $794

### Step 2: Apply Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities): $622 (shelter) + $72 (utilities) = $694
   - 50% of net income after deductions: 
     - Net income: $303
     - 50% of $303 = $151.50
   - Excess shelter costs: $694 - $151.50 = $542.50
   - Since this amount exceeds the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we can only deduct $597.

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- Net Monthly Income Calculation:
  - Gross Income: $794
  - Deductions: $177 (standard) + $0 (earned income) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $597 (excess shelter) = $774
  - Net Monthly Income: $794 - $774 = $20

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person: $250
- 30% of Net Monthly Income: 
  - 30% of $20 = $6
- Final SNAP Benefit Calculation:
  - SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income

   - Total Shelter Costs: $1,658 (includes rent and utilities)
   - Utilities: $322
   - Total Shelter Costs (Rent + Utilities): $1,658 + $322 = $1,980
   - Net Income after deductions: $1,153
   - 50% of Net Income: $1,153 * 0.50 = $576.50
   - Excess Shelter Costs: $1,980 - $576.50 = $1,403.50 (this amount can be deducted)

### Step 3: Calculate Total Deductions
- Total Deductions:
  - Earned Income Deduction: $502.40
  - Standard Deduction: $177
  - Excess Shelter Costs: $1,403.50
- Total Deductions: $502.40 + $177 + $1,403.50 = $2,083.90

### Step 4: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- Net Monthly Income: $1,153
- Adjusted Net Income after Deductions: $1,153 - $2,083.90 = -$930.90 (This means the household has no net income for SNAP calculation)

### Step 5: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person: $250
- 30% of Adjusted Net Income: 30% of $0 = $0 (since the adjusted net income is negative)
- SNAP Benefit Calculation: $250 - $0 = $250

### Step 6: Resource Limits
- Total Assets: $0 (household is not categorically eligible, but has no resources)
- Resource Limit for households with a member over 60: $3,750 (no limit applies since the household has no resources)

### Step 7: Certification Period
- The certification period for SNAP is typically 12 months for households without changes in circumstances.

### Final Calculation
- **Final Calculated Benefit**: $250

Thus, the final calculated benefit for this SNAP application is:

1. **Gross Monthly Income**: $0
2. **Net Monthly Income**: $0

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the gross income is $0, the earned income deduction is also $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 2, the standard deduction is $258 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities): $1346 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $1668
  - 50% of net income after deductions: 50% of $0 = $0
  - Since the total shelter costs exceed 50% of the net income, the excess shelter cost is $1668.

### Calculation of Net Income
Net Income = Gross Income - Deductions
- Gross Income: $0
- Deductions: $0 (earned income) + $258 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $1668 (excess shelter) = $1926

Net Income = $0 - $1926 = $-1926 (Net Income cannot be negative, so it is considered $0 for SNAP calculations).

### Final Calculation of Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 2 people**: $459
- **30% of Net Income**: 30% of $0 = $0

Final SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income
Final SNAP Benefit = $459 - $0 = $459

Thus, the final calculated benefit for this household is:

### Step 1: Determine Gross and Net Income
- **Gross Income**: $1,343
- **Net Income**: $1,166

### Step 2: Apply Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 2, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $484 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $806.
   - The household's net income after deductions = $1,166.
   - 50% of net income = $1,166 * 0.5 = $583.
   - Excess shelter costs = $806 - $583 = $223.
   - Since the excess shelter costs are less than the maximum shelter deduction of $597, the full amount of $223 can be deducted.

### Step 3: Calculate Total Deductions
- Total deductions = Standard Deduction + Excess Shelter Costs
- Total deductions = $177 + $223 = $400.

### Step 4: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - Total Deductions
- Net Monthly Income = $1,343 - $400 = $943.

### Step 5: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for a household of 2 = $459.
- 30% of Net Monthly Income = $943 * 0.3 = $282.90 (rounded to $283).
- SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Monthly Income
- SNAP Benefit = $459 - $283 = $176.

### Step 6: Resource Limits
- The household has no countable resources (liquid assets = $0).
- Since there is one person with a disability, the resource limit is $3,750, which is not exceeded.

### Step 7: Certification Period
- The certification period for SNAP is typically 12 months for households with a member who is disabled.

### Final Calculation
The final calculated benefit for this household is:

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Earned income = $0
   - 20% of $0 = $0

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - Household size = 2
   - Standard deduction = $177

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - Dependent care expenses = $0
   - Deduction = $0

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - Child support = $0
   - Deduction = $0

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs = Rent + Utilities = $659 + $322 = $981
   - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of ($1518 - $0 - $177 - $0 - $0) = 50% of $1341 = $670.50
   - Excess shelter cost = $981 - $670.50 = $310.50
   - Since the excess shelter cost is more than $0, we can apply the full amount of excess shelter cost as a deduction.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- Gross monthly income = $1518
- Total deductions = $0 (earned income) + $177 (standard) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $310.50 (excess shelter) = $487.50
- Net monthly income = $1518 - $487.50 = $1030.50

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
1. **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size of 2**: 
   - Maximum allotment = $459

2. **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
   - 30% of $1030.50 = $309.15

3. **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**: 
   - SNAP benefit = Maximum allotment - 30% of net income = $459 - $309.15 = $149.85
   - Since SNAP benefits are rounded down to the nearest whole dollar, the final calculated benefit is $149.

1. **Household Size**: 2 individuals
2. **Gross Monthly Income**: $0
3. **Net Monthly Income**: $0
4. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the gross income is $0, the deduction is also $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 2, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
   - **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support reported).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: $0 (no shelter costs reported).

5. **Calculating Net Income**:
   - Gross Income: $0
   - Deductions: $0 (earned income) + $178 (standard deduction) = $178
   - Net Income: $0 - $178 = $0 (Net income cannot be negative, so it is considered $0).

6. **Maximum Monthly Allotment**: For a household of 2, the maximum monthly allotment is $459.

7. **Calculating SNAP Benefits**:
   - The monthly allotment is calculated as the maximum allotment minus 30% of the net monthly income.
   - 30% of Net Income: 30% of $0 = $0.
   - SNAP Benefit Calculation: $459 - $0 = $459.

8. **Final Calculated Benefit**: 
   - Since the household is homeless and has no shelter costs, the calculated benefit remains the same.

1. **Gross Monthly Income**: $1710
2. **Net Monthly Income**: $1533

### Deductions:
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 3, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $322 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $644
  - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of $1533 = $766. Since $644 is less than $766, the household does not qualify for an excess shelter deduction.

### Total Deductions:
- Total deductions = Standard Deduction + Earned Income Deduction + Dependent Care Deduction + Child Support = $178 + $0 + $0 + $0 = $178

### Net Income Calculation:
- Net Income after deductions = Net Monthly Income - Total Deductions = $1533 - $178 = $1355

### SNAP Benefit Calculation:
- The monthly allotment for a household of 3 is $658.
- 30% of the net income = 30% of $1355 = $406.50
- Final SNAP benefit = Maximum Monthly Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $658 - $406.50 = $251.50

### Step 1: Determine Household Size and Composition
- **Household Size**: 1
- **Household Members Over 60**: 0
- **Household Members with a Disability**: 1

### Step 2: Gross and Net Income
- **Gross Income**: $651
- **Net Income**: $389

### Step 3: Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.
2. **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.
3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total Shelter Costs: $322 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $644
   - 50% of Net Income: 50% of $389 = $194.5
   - Excess Shelter Costs: $644 - $194.5 = $449.5 (this amount is eligible for deduction).

### Step 4: Calculate Total Deductions
- Total Deductions = 20% Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction + Dependent Care Deduction + Legally Owed Child Support + Excess Shelter Costs
- Total Deductions = $0 + $177 + $0 + $0 + $449.5 = $626.5

### Step 5: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - Total Deductions
- Net Monthly Income = $651 - $626.5 = $24.5

### Step 6: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 1: $250
- 30% of Net Monthly Income: 30% of $24.5 = $7.35
- SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income
- SNAP Benefit = $250 - $7.35 = $242.65

### Step 7: Final Calculation
Since SNAP benefits are rounded down to the nearest whole dollar, the final calculated benefit is:
{Final Calculated Benefit: 242} 

### Step 8: Resource Limits
- Total Assets: $0 (the household has no countable resources).
- Resource Limit for households with a member with a disability: $3,750 (the household is eligible as it is below this limit).

### Conclusion
The household is eligible for SNAP benefits, and the final calculated benefit is {Final Calculated Benefit: 242}.","1 individual(s) listed in this SNAP application.

1. **Household Size**: 1 individual
2. **Gross Monthly Income**: $2,723
3. **Net Monthly Income**: $2,001

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
  - 20% of $2,723 = $544.60
- **Standard Deduction**: 
  - For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support reported).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total shelter costs = $0 (no shelter expenses reported).
  
### Calculation of Net Income
Net Income = Gross Income - Deductions
- Total Deductions = $544.60 (earned income deduction) + $178 (standard deduction) = $722.60
- Net Income = $2,723 - $722.60 = $2,000.40

### SNAP Allotment Calculation
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 Person**: $250
- **30% of Net Income**: 
  - 30% of $2,000.40 = $600.12
- **Final SNAP Allotment**: 
  - Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $250 - $600.12 = Negative value, which means the household is not eligible for benefits.

### Final Calculation
Since the calculated SNAP allotment is negative, the household is not eligible for SNAP benefits.

1. **Household Size**: 2 individuals
2. **Gross Monthly Income**: $3,992
3. **Net Monthly Income**: $3,017

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
  - 20% of $3,992 = $798.40
- **Standard Deduction**: 
  - For a household of 2, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
  - $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
  - $0 (no child support reported).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - $0 (no shelter costs reported).

### Calculation of Net Income
Net Income = Gross Income - Deductions
- Total Deductions = $798.40 (earned income deduction) + $178 (standard deduction) = $976.40
- Net Income = $3,992 - $976.40 = $3,015.60

### SNAP Allotment Calculation
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 2 people**: $459
- **30% of Net Income**: 
  - 30% of $3,015.60 = $904.68
- **Final SNAP Allotment**: 
  - Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $459 - $904.68 = Negative value, which means the household is not eligible for benefits.

Since the calculated benefit is negative, the household is not eligible for SNAP benefits.

2. **Categorical Eligibility**: The household is categorically eligible through TANF.
3. **Gross Monthly Income**: $1185
4. **Net Monthly Income**: $411

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 4, the standard deduction is $184.
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total Shelter Costs: $1672 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $1994
  - 50% of Net Income: 50% of $411 = $205.5
  - Excess Shelter Costs: $1994 - $205.5 = $1788.5
  - Since this exceeds the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we will use $597 for the deduction.

### Total Deductions
- Total Deductions = Standard Deduction + Excess Shelter Costs
- Total Deductions = $184 + $597 = $781

### Net Monthly Income Calculation
- Net Monthly Income = Gross Monthly Income - Total Deductions
- Net Monthly Income = $1185 - $781 = $404

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Gross earned income: $0
   - Deduction: $0 (20% of $0)

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - Household size: 1
   - Standard deduction for household size 1: $177

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported)

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no child support received)

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities): $322 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $644
   - 50% of net income after deductions: 
     - Net income: $1363
     - 50% of $1363 = $681.50
   - Since $644 (shelter costs) is less than $681.50, there are no excess shelter costs to deduct.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
  - Gross income: $1540
  - Total deductions: $177 (standard deduction) + $0 (earned income deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) = $177
  - Net income after deductions: $1540 - $177 = $1363

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 1**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
  - 30% of $1363 = $408.90
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**: 
  - Maximum allotment - 30% of net income: $250 - $408.90 = Negative value, which means the household is not eligible for benefits.

### Step 4: Resource Limits
- **Liquid Resources**: $1546.00
- **Resource Limit for Household with Disability**: $3,750
- Since the household's liquid resources ($1546.00) are below the limit, they meet the resource eligibility requirement.

### Conclusion
The household is not eligible for SNAP benefits because the calculated benefit amount is negative after applying the 30% deduction from net income.

1. **Gross Monthly Income**: $2,680
2. **Net Monthly Income**: $1,967

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
  - 20% of $2,680 = $536
- **Standard Deduction**: 
  - For a household size of 1-2, the standard deduction is $177.
  
### Total Deductions
- Total deductions = 20% Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction
- Total deductions = $536 + $177 = $713

### Net Income Calculation
- Net Income = Gross Income - Total Deductions
- Net Income = $2,680 - $713 = $1,967 (This matches the reported net income)

### Shelter Costs
- Total Shelter Costs = Rent + Utilities
- Rent = $572
- Utilities = $322
- Total Shelter Costs = $572 + $322 = $894

### Excess Shelter Deduction
- Since the household is homeless, we will consider the maximum shelter deduction.
- Maximum Shelter Deduction for 2022 = $597

### Final Net Income Calculation
- Net Income after Shelter Deduction = Net Income - Excess Shelter Deduction
- Net Income after Shelter Deduction = $1,967 - $597 = $1,370

### SNAP Allotment Calculation
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person = $250
- 30% of Net Income after Shelter Deduction = 30% of $1,370 = $411

### Final SNAP Benefit Calculation
- SNAP Benefit = Maximum Monthly Allotment - 30% of Net Income after Shelter Deduction
- SNAP Benefit = $250 - $411 = -$161 (This indicates that the household is not eligible for benefits as the calculated benefit is negative)

1. **Household Information**:
   - Household Size: 1
   - Age 60 or older: 0
   - Disability: 1
   - Homeless: Yes
   - Total Gross Income: $2,426
   - Total Net Income: $2,044
   - Shelter Expenses: $897 (includes rent)
   - Utilities: $322
   - Dependent Care: $0
   - Child Support: $0
   - Total Assets: $0

2. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
     - Earned Income: $1,028
     - 20% of $1,028 = $205.60
   - **Standard Deduction**: 
     - For a household size of 1: $177
   - **Shelter Deduction**: 
     - Total Shelter Costs: $897 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $1,219
     - Excess Shelter Costs: $1,219 - (50% of Net Income)
     - 50% of Net Income: 0.5 * $2,044 = $1,022
     - Excess Shelter Costs: $1,219 - $1,022 = $197
   - **Maximum Shelter Deduction**: $597 (but we will use the calculated excess shelter costs since it is less than the maximum).
   - **Medical Expenses**: Not applicable since the household does not have out-of-pocket medical expenses exceeding $35.

3. **Total Deductions**:
   - Total Deductions = Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction + Shelter Deduction
   - Total Deductions = $205.60 + $177 + $197 = $579.60

4. **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
   - Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - Total Deductions
   - Net Monthly Income = $2,426 - $579.60 = $1,846.40

5. **SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
   - Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 1: $250
   - 30% of Net Monthly Income: 0.3 * $1,846.40 = $553.92
   - SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income
   - SNAP Benefit = $250 - $553.92 (since this is negative, the benefit will be $0)

6. **Final Calculated Benefit**:
   - Since the calculated benefit is negative, the household is not eligible for SNAP benefits.

1. **Gross Monthly Income**: $25
2. **Net Monthly Income**: $0

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the gross income is $25 and it is considered unearned income, this deduction does not apply.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support reported).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: The household spends $25 on shelter. Since this is less than half of the net income ($0), there are no excess shelter costs to deduct.

### Calculation of Net Income
- **Net Income Calculation**:
  - Gross Income: $25
  - Standard Deduction: $178
  - Total Deductions: $178 (since no other deductions apply)
  
  Net Income = Gross Income - Total Deductions
  Net Income = $25 - $178 = -$153 (but net income cannot be negative, so it is considered $0).

### Final Calculation of Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 Person**: $250
- **30% of Net Income**: 30% of $0 = $0

### SNAP Benefit Calculation
- SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income
- SNAP Benefit = $250 - $0 = $250

1. **Gross Monthly Income**: $2,197
2. **Net Monthly Income**: $784

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
  - 20% of $2,197 = $439.40
- **Standard Deduction**: 
  - For a household size of 2, the standard deduction is $177.
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
  - The household spends $200 on dependent care.
- **Child Support Payments**: 
  - $0 (no child support payments).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total shelter costs = Rent + Utilities = $1,422 + $322 = $1,744.
  - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of $784 = $392.
  - Excess shelter costs = $1,744 - $392 = $1,352 (this amount is eligible for deduction).

### Total Deductions
- Total deductions = Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction + Dependent Care Deduction + Excess Shelter Costs
- Total deductions = $439.40 + $177 + $200 + $1,352 = $2,168.40

### Net Monthly Income Calculation
- Net Monthly Income after deductions = Gross Monthly Income - Total Deductions
- Net Monthly Income after deductions = $2,197 - $2,168.40 = $28.60

### SNAP Allotment Calculation
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for a household of 2 = $459.
- 30% of the household's net monthly income = 30% of $28.60 = $8.58.
- Final SNAP benefit = Maximum Monthly Allotment - 30% of Net Monthly Income

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Gross income: $794
   - Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities): $822 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $1,144
   - 50% of net income after deductions: 
     - Net income: $103
     - 50% of $103 = $51.50
   - Excess shelter costs: $1,144 - $51.50 = $1,092.50
   - Since this amount exceeds the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we will use $597 for the deduction.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Income Calculation**:
   - Gross Income: $794
   - Deductions: $177 (standard) + $0 (earned income) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $597 (excess shelter) = $774
   - Net Monthly Income: $794 - $774 = $20

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size of 1**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
   - 30% of $20 = $6
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**: 
   - Maximum allotment - 30% of net income = $250 - $6 = $244

   - Age: 1 person over 60
   - Homeless: Yes
   - Total Gross Income: $794
   - Total Net Income: $541

2. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
   - **Child Support Deduction**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
     - Total Shelter Costs: $384 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $706
     - 50% of Net Income: 50% of $541 = $270.5
     - Excess Shelter Costs: $706 - $270.5 = $435.5 (this amount is eligible for deduction).
     - However, the maximum shelter deduction allowed is $597, so we can deduct the full excess amount of $435.5.

3. **Total Deductions**:
   - Total Deductions = 20% Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction + Dependent Care Deduction + Child Support Deduction + Excess Shelter Costs
   - Total Deductions = $0 + $177 + $0 + $0 + $435.5 = $612.5

4. **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:

1. **Gross Income**: $1844
2. **Net Income**: $1299

### Deductions:
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
  - 20% of $1844 = $368.80
- **Standard Deduction**: 
  - For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support**: $0 (no child support reported).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Since the household is homeless and spends $0 on shelter, there are no excess shelter costs to consider.

### Calculation of Net Monthly Income:
Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - (Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction)
- Net Monthly Income = $1844 - ($368.80 + $178) = $1844 - $546.80 = $1297.20

### SNAP Allotment Calculation:
1. **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 Person**: $250
2. **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
   - 30% of $1297.20 = $389.16
3. **Final SNAP Allotment**: 
   - Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $250 - $389.16 = Negative value, which means the household is not eligible for benefits.

Since the calculated benefit is negative, the household is not eligible for SNAP benefits.

### Step 1: Determine Household Size and Composition
- **Household Size**: 1
- **Age**: 1 person over 60
- **Disability**: 0 people with a disability
- **Homeless**: Yes

### Step 2: Income Information
- **Gross Income**: $940
- **Net Income**: $297

### Step 3: Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   
2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - $0 (no child support received).

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs: $847 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $1,169.
   - 50% of net income after deductions: 50% of $297 = $148.50.
   - Excess shelter costs: $1,169 - $148.50 = $1,020.50.
   - Since this exceeds the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we will use $597 for the calculation.

### Step 4: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
   - Gross Income: $940
   - Deductions: 
     - 20% Earned Income Deduction: $0
     - Standard Deduction: $177
     - Dependent Care Deduction: $0
     - Child Support: $0
     - Excess Shelter Deduction: $597
   - Total Deductions: $0 + $177 + $0 + $0 + $597 = $774.
   - Net Monthly Income: $940 - $774 = $166.

### Step 5: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 Person**: $250.
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 30% of $166 = $49.80.
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**: 
   - Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $250 - $49.80 = $200.20.
   - Since benefits are rounded down to the nearest dollar, the final calculated benefit is $200.

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Gross earned income: $0
   - Deduction: $0 (20% of $0)

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - Household size: 1
   - Standard deduction for household size 1: $177

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported)

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no child support received)

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs: $322 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $644
   - 50% of net income after deductions: 
     - Net income: $603
     - 50% of $603 = $301.50
   - Excess shelter costs: $644 - $301.50 = $342.50
   - Since the excess shelter costs exceed the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we will use the maximum shelter deduction of $597.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Income Calculation**:
   - Gross income: $794
   - Total deductions: $177 (standard) + $0 (earned income) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $597 (shelter) = $774
   - Net monthly income: $794 - $774 = $20

### Step 3: Determine SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 1**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
   - 30% of $20 = $6
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**: 
   - Maximum allotment - 30% of net income = $250 - $6 = $244

1. **Household Size**: 2 individuals
2. **Gross Monthly Income**: $2,160
3. **Net Monthly Income**: $1,386

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 2, the standard deduction is $177.
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support reported).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total shelter costs: $1,594
  - 50% of net income after deductions: 50% of $1,386 = $693
  - Excess shelter costs: $1,594 - $693 = $901 (this amount can be deducted).

### Total Deductions
- Total deductions = Standard Deduction + Excess Shelter Costs
- Total deductions = $177 + $901 = $1,078

### Net Monthly Income Calculation
- Net Monthly Income after deductions = Net Income - Total Deductions
- Net Monthly Income after deductions = $1,386 - $1,078 = $308

### SNAP Allotment Calculation
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for a household of 2: $459
- 30% of the household's net monthly income: 30% of $308 = $92.40
- SNAP allotment = Maximum Monthly Allotment - 30% of Net Monthly Income
- SNAP allotment = $459 - $92.40 = $366.60

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Gross earned income: $0
   - 20% of $0 = $0

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household of 2, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - $0 (no child support reported).

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs: $0
   - Since the household spends $0 on shelter, there are no excess shelter costs to deduct.

6. **Medical Expenses**: 
   - Not applicable since there are no out-of-pocket medical expenses reported.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Income Calculation**:
   - Gross Income: $522
   - Deductions: $0 (earned income) + $178 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) = $178
   - Net Income: $522 - $178 = $344

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
1. **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size**:
   - For 2 individuals, the maximum monthly allotment is $459.

2. **30% of Net Monthly Income**:
   - 30% of $344 = $103.20

3. **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
   - SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income
   - SNAP Benefit = $459 - $103.20 = $355.80

### Step 1: Determine Gross and Net Income
- **Gross Income**: $794
- **Net Income**: $0

### Step 2: Apply Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 1-2, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $972 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $1,294.
   - 50% of the household's net income after deductions = 50% of $0 = $0.
   - Since the total shelter costs exceed 50% of the net income, the excess shelter costs are calculated as follows:
     - Total shelter costs: $1,294
     - Subtract 50% of net income: $1,294 - $0 = $1,294.
   - However, the maximum shelter deduction allowed is $597.

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
  - Gross Income: $794
  - Deductions: 
    - Standard Deduction: $177
    - Shelter Deduction: $597
  - Total Deductions: $177 + $597 = $774
  - Net Monthly Income: $794 - $774 = $20

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 Person**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
  - 30% of $20 = $6
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
  - Maximum Allotment: $250
  - Subtract 30% of Net Income: $250 - $6 = $244

### Step 5: Resource Limits
- The household has total assets of $0 and liquid assets of $29. Since the household is not categorically eligible, the resource limit for a household with no members over 60 or disabled is $2,500. The household is below this limit.

### Final Calculation
- The final calculated benefit for the household is:

1. **Household Composition**: 
   - 1 individual in the household.
   - No one over 60 or with a disability.

2. **Income**:
   - Total gross income: $0
   - Total net income: $0

3. **Deductions**:
   - 20% deduction on earned income: 20% of $0 = $0
   - Standard deduction: The standard deduction for a household of 1 is $178 (as of FY 2022).
   - Dependent care deduction: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - Legally owed child support payments: $0.
   - Excess shelter costs: $0 (no shelter costs).
   - Medical expenses: $0 (no medical expenses).

4. **Calculating Net Monthly Income**:
   - Gross income: $0
   - Deductions: $0 (20% of earned income) + $178 (standard deduction) = $178
   - Net monthly income: $0 - $178 = -$178 (but net income cannot be negative, so it is considered $0).

5. **Maximum Monthly Allotment**:
   - For a household of 1, the maximum monthly allotment is $250.

6. **Calculating SNAP Benefits**:
   - The household's monthly allotment is calculated as:
     - Maximum allotment: $250
     - 30% of net monthly income: 30% of $0 = $0
   - Final SNAP benefit calculation: $250 - $0 = $250.

7. **Resource Limits**:
   - The household has reported liquid assets of $20. Since the household is not categorically eligible, we need to check resource limits.
   - The resource limit for a household of 1 is $2,750 (as of FY 2022). The household's assets ($20) are below this limit.

8. **Certification Period**:
   - The certification period for a household with no income and no resources exceeding the limit is typically 12 months.

Based on the calculations and the information provided, the final calculated benefit for this household is:

### Step 1: Determine Household Size and Composition
- **Household Size**: 1
- **Age**: 1 person over 60 years old
- **Disability**: 0 people with a disability
- **Homeless**: Yes

### Step 2: Income Calculation
- **Gross Income**: $794
- **Net Income**: $0

### Step 3: Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   
2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $962 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $1,284.
   - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of $0 = $0.
   - Since the total shelter costs exceed 50% of the net income, the excess shelter costs are calculated as follows:
     - Total shelter costs: $1,284
     - Subtract 50% of net income: $1,284 - $0 = $1,284.
   - The maximum shelter deduction is $597, so the deduction for excess shelter costs is capped at $597.

### Total Deductions
- Total deductions = 20% earned income deduction ($0) + standard deduction ($177) + dependent care deduction ($0) + child support deduction ($0) + excess shelter costs ($597) = $177 + $597 = $774.

### Step 4: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - Total Deductions
- Net Monthly Income = $794 - $774 = $20.

### Step 5: Determine SNAP Allotment
- The maximum monthly allotment for a household of 1 is $250.
- Calculate the benefit amount:
  - 30% of net monthly income = 30% of $20 = $6.
  - SNAP benefit = Maximum allotment - 30% of net income = $250 - $6 = $244.

### Step 6: Resource Limits
- The household has total assets of $0, which is below the resource limit of $2,500 for households without a member who is age 60 or older or disabled. Since there is a member over 60, the limit is $3,750, which is also satisfied.

### Step 7: Certification Period
- The certification period for SNAP is typically 12 months for households with elderly or disabled members.

### Final Calculation
- **Final Calculated Benefit**: $244.

Thus, the final calculated benefit for this SNAP application is:

### Step 1: Determine Gross and Net Income
- **Gross Income**: $1212
- **Net Income**: $765

### Step 2: Apply Deductions
1. **20% Deduction on Earned Income**: 
   - Since there is no earned income reported, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 2, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $787 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $1109.
   - Since the household's net income after deductions is $765, we calculate 50% of that: 
     - 50% of $765 = $382.50.
   - Excess shelter costs = $1109 - $382.50 = $726.50.
   - The maximum shelter deduction allowed is $597, so we will use that amount.

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
  - Net Income = Gross Income - (Standard Deduction + Shelter Deduction)
  - Net Income = $1212 - ($177 + $597) = $1212 - $774 = $438.

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**:
  - 30% of $438 = $131.40.

- **Final SNAP Allotment Calculation**:
  - Maximum Monthly Allotment for a household of 2 = $459.
  - SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $459 - $131.40 = $327.60.

- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
  - 20% of $3,908 = $781.60
- **Standard Deduction**: 
  - For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support reported).

### Calculation of Net Income
Net Income = Gross Income - Deductions
- Total Deductions = $781.60 (earned income deduction) + $178 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) = $959.60
- Net Income = $3,908 - $959.60 = $2,948.40

### SNAP Allotment Calculation
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 Person**: $250
- **30% of Net Income**: 
  - 30% of $2,948.40 = $884.52
- **Final SNAP Allotment**: 
  - Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $250 - $884.52 = -$634.52

   - Shelter Expenses: $1,147 (includes rent and utilities)
   - Utilities: $322
   - Dependent Care: $0
   - Child Support: $0
   - Assets: $0 (no resource limit applies since the household is not categorically eligible)

2. **Deductions**:

     - 20% of $3,576 = $715.20
   - **Standard Deduction** (for household size 1): 
     - $177
   - **Total Deductions**:

3. **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:

   - Excess Shelter Costs: 
     - $1,147 - $895.90 = $251.10 (this amount can be deducted)
   - Since the excess shelter cost is less than the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we can use the full amount of $251.10.

5. **Final Net Income Calculation**:
   - Adjusted Net Income: 
     - $1,791.80 - $251.10 = $1,540.70

6. **SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
   - Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 1: $250

   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the earned income is $0, this deduction is also $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 2, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
   - **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support reported).

   - **Dependent care deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - **Legally owed child support payments**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Excess shelter costs**: Since the household spends $0 on shelter, there are no excess shelter costs to consider.

4. **Medical Expenses**: 
   - Since there are no medical expenses reported, this deduction is $0.

5. **Calculating Net Monthly Income**:
   - Gross Income: $0
   - Deductions: $0 (earned income deduction) + $193 (standard deduction) = $193
   - Net Monthly Income: $0 - $193 = -$193 (but we consider it as $0 for SNAP calculations).

6. **Maximum Monthly Allotment**:
   - For a household of 1, the maximum monthly allotment is $250.

7. **Calculating SNAP Benefits**:
   - The household's monthly allotment will be calculated as follows:
   - Monthly allotment = Maximum allotment - (30% of net monthly income)
   - 30% of net monthly income = 30% of $0 = $0
   - Monthly allotment = $250 - $0 = $250

8. **Final Calculated Benefit**:
   - Since the household is homeless and has no income, they are eligible for the full benefit amount.

1. **Household Information**:
   - Household Size: 1
   - Age: 1 person over 60
   - Disability: 0
   - Homeless: Yes
   - Total Gross Income: $970
   - Total Net Income: $793

2. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
     - Total Shelter Costs: $322 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $644
     - 50% of Net Income: 50% of $793 = $396.5
     - Excess Shelter Costs: $644 - $396.5 = $247.5 (this amount is less than the maximum shelter deduction of $597, so we can use it).
   - **Medical Expenses**: Not applicable since there are no out-of-pocket medical expenses reported.

3. **Calculating Net Monthly Income**:
   - Net Income: $793
   - Total Deductions: $0 (earned income) + $177 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $247.5 (excess shelter) = $424.5

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
  - 20% of $2,593 = $518.60
- **Standard Deduction**: 
  - For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support reported).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total shelter costs = $0 (no shelter expenses reported).
  
Since there are no excess shelter costs, we do not need to calculate this deduction.

### Total Deductions
- Total deductions = 20% Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction
- Total deductions = $518.60 + $178 = $696.60

### Net Income Calculation
- Net Income = Gross Income - Total Deductions
- Net Income = $2,593 - $696.60 = $1,896.40

### SNAP Allotment Calculation
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person**: $250
- **30% of Net Income**: 
  - 30% of $1,896.40 = $568.92
- **Final SNAP Allotment**: 
  - Maximum Monthly Allotment - 30% of Net Income

   - 30% of Net Income: 30% of $0 = $0.
   - SNAP Benefit Calculation: $459 - $0 = $459.

8. **Final Calculated Benefit**: 
   - Since the household is homeless and has no shelter costs, the calculated benefit remains the same.

Therefore, the final calculated benefit for this household is:

1. **Gross Monthly Income**: $2,846
2. **Net Monthly Income**: $2,100

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
  - 20% of $2,846 = $569.20
- **Standard Deduction**: 
  - For a household of 2, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
  - $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
  - $0 (no child support reported).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - $0 (no shelter costs reported).

### Calculation of Net Income
Net Income = Gross Income - Deductions
- Total Deductions = $569.20 (earned income deduction) + $178 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) = $747.20
- Net Income = $2,846 - $747.20 = $2,098.80 (rounded to $2,099 for SNAP calculations).

### SNAP Allotment Calculation
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 2 people**: $459
- **30% of Net Income**: 
  - 30% of $2,099 = $629.70 (rounded to $630).
  
### Final SNAP Benefit Calculation
- SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income
- SNAP Benefit = $459 - $630 = -$171 (which means the household is not eligible for benefits).

Since the calculated benefit is negative, the household is not eligible for SNAP benefits.

### Step 1: Determine Gross Monthly Income
- Gross Monthly Income: $529

### Step 2: Apply Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 1-2, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total Shelter Costs: $522 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $844
   - 50% of Net Income after deductions: 
     - Net Income: $6.00
     - 50% of $6.00 = $3.00
   - Excess Shelter Costs: $844 - $3.00 = $841 (this amount exceeds the maximum shelter deduction of $597, so we will use $597).

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- Net Monthly Income Calculation:
  - Gross Income: $529
  - Deductions: 
    - Standard Deduction: $177
    - Excess Shelter Deduction: $597
  - Total Deductions: $177 + $597 = $774
  - Net Monthly Income: $529 - $774 = -$245 (Since net income cannot be negative, we will consider it as $0 for the purpose of calculating benefits).

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person: $250
- 30% of Net Monthly Income: 30% of $0 = $0
- Final SNAP Benefit Calculation:
  - Maximum Allotment: $250
  - Subtract 30% of Net Income: $250 - $0 = $250

1. **Gross Monthly Income**: $4,928
2. **Net Monthly Income**: $3,766

### Deductions:
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
  - 20% of $4,928 = $985.60
- **Standard Deduction**: 
  - For a household size of 1-2, the standard deduction is $177.
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
  - $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Child Support Payments**: 
  - $0 (no child support received).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total shelter costs = Rent ($122) + Utilities ($72) = $194.
  - Since the total shelter costs ($194) are less than half of the net income after deductions, we do not apply this deduction.

### Total Deductions:
- Total deductions = Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction
- Total deductions = $985.60 + $177 = $1,162.60

### Net Income Calculation:
- Net Income after deductions = Net Monthly Income - Total Deductions
- Net Income after deductions = $3,766 - $1,162.60 = $2,603.40

### SNAP Allotment Calculation:
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person**: $250
- **30% of Net Income**: 
  - 30% of $2,603.40 = $781.02
- **Final SNAP Allotment**: 
  - Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $250 - $781.02

### Step 1: Determine Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Earned income = $0
   - Deduction = 20% of $0 = $0

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - Household size = 1 (since there is 1 individual)
   - Standard deduction for household size 1 = $177

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - Amount = $0 (no dependent care expenses reported)

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - Amount = $0 (no child support received)

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs = $639 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $961
   - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of ($726 - $0 - $177) = 50% of $549 = $274.50
   - Excess shelter costs = $961 - $274.50 = $686.50
   - Since the maximum shelter deduction is $597, we will use that amount.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- Gross monthly income = $1087
- Total deductions = $0 (earned income) + $177 (standard) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $597 (shelter) = $774
- Net monthly income = Gross income - Total deductions = $1087 - $774 = $313

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person = $250
- 30% of net monthly income = 30% of $313 = $93.90
- Final SNAP benefit = Maximum allotment - 30% of net income = $250 - $93.90 = $156.10

1. **Gross Monthly Income**: $3,814
2. **Net Monthly Income**: $2,875

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
  - 20% of $3,814 = $762.80
- **Standard Deduction**: 
  - For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
  - $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Child Support Payments**: 
  - $0 (no child support payments reported).
- **Medical Expenses**: 
  - $0 (no medical expenses reported).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total shelter costs: $986
  - 50% of net income after deductions: 
    - Net income after deductions = $2,875 - $762.80 - $178 = $1,934.20
    - 50% of $1,934.20 = $967.10
  - Since $986 (shelter costs) is greater than $967.10, the excess shelter cost is $986 - $967.10 = $18.90.

### Total Deductions
- Total deductions = Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction + Excess Shelter Cost
- Total deductions = $762.80 + $178 + $18.90 = $959.70

### Net Income Calculation
- Net Income = Gross Income - Total Deductions
- Net Income = $3,814 - $959.70 = $2,854.30

### SNAP Benefit Calculation
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person: $250
- 30% of Net Income: 
  - 30% of $2,854.30 = $856.29
- Final SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income
- Final SNAP Benefit = $250 - $856.29 = -$606.29

Since the calculated benefit cannot be negative, the household is not eligible for SNAP benefits.

1. **Household Composition**: 
   - 1 individual in the household.
   - 1 person with a disability.

2. **Income**:
   - Gross Income: $734
   - Net Income: $485

3. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses).

     - Excess Shelter Costs: $350 - $242.5 = $107.5 (this amount can be deducted).

4. **Calculating Net Monthly Income**:
   - Starting with the Net Income: $485
   - Subtract the Standard Deduction: $485 - $178 = $307
   - Subtract the Excess Shelter Costs: $307 - $107.5 = $199.5

5. **Final Calculation of SNAP Benefits**:
   - The household's maximum monthly allotment for 1 person is $250.
   - Calculate 30% of the Net Monthly Income: 30% of $199.5 = $59.85.
   - Subtract this from the maximum allotment: $250 - $59.85 = $190.15.

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Gross income: $943
   - Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 2, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities): $322 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $644
   - 50% of net income after deductions: 
     - Net income: $766
     - 50% of $766 = $383
   - Excess shelter costs: $644 - $383 = $261 (this is the amount that can be deducted).
   - Since the household is eligible for the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we will use $261 as the excess shelter cost deduction.

6. **Medical Expenses**: 
   - The household can deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses over $35. Since there are no reported medical expenses, this deduction is $0.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Income Calculation**:
  - Net income: $766
  - Total deductions: $177 (standard) + $0 (earned income) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $261 (excess shelter) + $0 (medical) = $438
  - Adjusted net income: $766 - $438 = $328

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size of 2**: $459
- **30% of Adjusted Net Income**: 
  - 30% of $328 = $98.40
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
  - SNAP benefit = Maximum allotment - 30% of net income
  - SNAP benefit = $459 - $98.40 = $360.60
  - Since benefits are rounded down to the nearest dollar, the final benefit is $360.

1. **Household Size**: 3 individuals
2. **Categorical Eligibility**: The household is categorically eligible for SNAP through TANF.
3. **Gross Monthly Income**: $521
4. **Net Monthly Income**: $51

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 3, the standard deduction is $177.
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total Shelter Costs: $465 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $787
  - 50% of Net Income: 50% of $51 = $25.50
  - Excess Shelter Costs: $787 - $25.50 = $761.50
  - Since this amount exceeds the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we will use $597 for the calculation.

### Net Income Calculation
- **Net Income**: 
  - Gross Income: $521
  - Deductions: $0 (earned income) + $177 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $597 (shelter costs) = $774
  - Net Income = $521 - $774 = -$253 (Since net income cannot be negative, we will consider it as $0 for the purpose of calculating benefits).

### SNAP Allotment Calculation
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size of 3**: $658
- **30% of Net Income**: 30% of $0 = $0
- **Final Allotment**: $658 - $0 = $658

### Resource Limits
- The household is categorically eligible, so there is no limit on resources.

### Certification Period
- The certification period for SNAP is typically 12 months for households that are categorically eligible.

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Gross earned income: $0
   - Deduction: $0 (20% of $0)

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - Household size: 1
   - Standard deduction for household size 1: $177

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported)

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no child support reported)

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs: $269
   - Net income after other deductions: $1098
   - 50% of net income: $549
   - Excess shelter costs: $269 - $549 = $0 (no excess shelter costs to deduct)

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income**: 
   - Gross income: $1275
   - Total deductions: $177 (standard deduction)
   - Net income after deductions: $1275 - $177 = $1098

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefit
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 1**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
   - 30% of $1098 = $329.40
   - Rounding: $329 (if rounding down)

- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**: 
   - Maximum allotment: $250
   - Subtract 30% of net income: $250 - $329 = $0 (since the result is negative, the benefit is $0)

### Final Calculation
The household is not eligible for SNAP benefits based on the provided information.

1. **Determine Gross and Net Income**:
   - Gross Income: $521
   - Net Income: $0

2. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the earned income is $0, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 2, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
   - **Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: The household spends $1000 on shelter expenses. Since the net income is $0, we will calculate the excess shelter costs:
     - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of $0 = $0.
     - Excess shelter costs = $1000 - $0 = $1000.

3. **Calculate Net Monthly Income**:
   - Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - Deductions
   - Deductions = 0 (earned income) + 177 (standard deduction) + 0 (dependent care) + 0 (child support) = $177.
   - Net Monthly Income = $521 - $177 = $344.

4. **Calculate SNAP Benefits**:
   - Maximum Monthly Allotment for a household of 2: $459.
   - 30% of Net Monthly Income: 30% of $344 = $103.20.
   - Final SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $459 - $103.20 = $355.80.

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the gross income is $0, the deduction is also $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).

  - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $322 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $644.
  - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of $0 = $0.
  - Excess shelter costs = $644 - $0 = $644.

Since the household has no income, the net income after deductions is $0. Therefore, the excess shelter costs will be fully deducted.

### Calculation of Net Income
- **Net Income Calculation**:
  - Gross Income: $0
  - Deductions: $178 (standard) + $0 (earned income) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $644 (excess shelter) = $822.
  - Net Income: $0 - $822 = $0 (Net income cannot be negative, so it remains $0).

### SNAP Allotment Calculation
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person**: $250.
- **30% of Net Income**: 30% of $0 = $0.
- **Final Allotment Calculation**: $250 (maximum allotment) - $0 (30% of net income) = $250.

   - Dependent care deduction: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - Legally owed child support payments: $0.
   - Excess shelter costs: $0 (no shelter costs).

4. **Net Income Calculation**:
   - Gross income: $0
   - Deductions: $0 (20% of earned income) + $178 (standard deduction) = $178
   - Net income: $0 - $178 = -$178 (Net income cannot be negative, so it is considered $0).

5. **Maximum Monthly Allotment**:
   - For a household of 1, the maximum monthly allotment is $250.

1. **Household Information**:
   - Household Size: 1
   - Age: 1 person over 60
   - Disability: 0
   - Gross Income: $502
   - Net Income: $165
   - Shelter Expenses: $322 (includes rent and utilities)
   - Dependent Care: $0
   - Child Support: $0
   - Total Assets: $0

2. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (not applicable).
   - **Legally Owed Child Support**: $0 (not applicable).
   - **Medical Expenses**: Since there are no out-of-pocket medical expenses reported, this deduction is $0.

3. **Calculating Net Monthly Income**:
   - Gross Income: $502
   - Deductions: $177 (standard deduction)
   - Net Income Calculation: 
     - $502 - $177 = $325 (this is the adjusted gross income after the standard deduction)

4. **Shelter Deduction**:
   - Total Shelter Costs: $322
   - 50% of Net Income after deductions: 
     - 50% of $325 = $162.5
   - Excess Shelter Costs: 
     - $322 - $162.5 = $159.5 (this is the excess shelter cost)
   - Since the excess shelter cost is less than the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we can use the full amount of $159.5.

5. **Final Net Income Calculation**:
   - Adjusted Gross Income: $325
   - Shelter Deduction: $159.5
   - Final Net Income: 
     - $325 - $159.5 = $165.5

### Step 1: Determine Household Size and Composition
- **Household Size**: 1
- **Age**: 1 person over 60 years old
- **Disability**: 0 people with a disability
- **Homeless**: Yes

### Step 2: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Earned income = $0
   - 20% deduction = $0

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - Household Size 1-2: $177

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - $0 (no dependent care expenses reported)

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - $0 (no child support received)

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total Shelter Costs = Rent + Utilities = $322 (shelter) + $0 (dependent care) = $322
   - Since the household is homeless, they qualify for the homeless shelter deduction of $159.73.

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Gross Monthly Income**: $1785
- **Total Deductions**: 
   - Standard Deduction: $177
   - Homeless Shelter Deduction: $159.73
   - Total Deductions = $177 + $159.73 = $336.73

- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
   - Net Income = Gross Income - Total Deductions
   - Net Income = $1785 - $336.73 = $1448.27

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 1**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
   - 30% of $1448.27 = $434.48

- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
   - SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income
   - SNAP Benefit = $250 - $434.48 = Negative value (not applicable)
   - Since the calculated value is negative, the household will receive $0 in benefits.

### Step 5: Resource Limits
- **Total Assets**: $0
- **Resource Limit for Households with a member over 60**: $3,750
- The household is below the resource limit.

### Final Calculation
- **Final Calculated Benefit**: $0 (the household does not qualify for benefits due to the negative calculation of SNAP benefits).

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**:
   - Earned Income: $977
   - 20% Deduction: $977 * 0.20 = $195.40

2. **Standard Deduction**:
   - Household Size: 4
   - Standard Deduction: $184

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**:
   - Amount: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported)

4. **Child Support Deduction**:
   - Amount: $0 (no child support received)

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**:
   - Total Shelter Costs: $731 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $1,053
   - Net Income after other deductions: $1,391
   - 50% of Net Income: $1,391 * 0.50 = $695.50
   - Excess Shelter Costs: $1,053 - $695.50 = $357.50 (this amount can be deducted)

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Total Deductions**:
  - Earned Income Deduction: $195.40
  - Standard Deduction: $184
  - Dependent Care Deduction: $0
  - Child Support Deduction: $0
  - Excess Shelter Deduction: $357.50

- **Total Deductions**: $195.40 + $184 + $0 + $0 + $357.50 = $736.90

- **Net Monthly Income**:
  - Gross Income: $1,794
  - Total Deductions: $736.90
  - Net Monthly Income: $1,794 - $736.90 = $1,057.10

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefit
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 4**: $835
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: $1,057.10 * 0.30 = $317.13

- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
  - SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income
  - SNAP Benefit = $835 - $317.13 = $517.87

1. **Gross Monthly Income**: $1,909
2. **Net Monthly Income**: $1,268

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).

   - Homeless: Yes
   - Total Gross Income: $560
   - Total Net Income: $252

2. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1-2, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
   - **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (none reported).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
     - Total Shelter Costs: $322 (rent) + $0 (utilities) = $322
     - 50% of Net Income: 50% of $252 = $126
     - Excess Shelter Cost: $322 - $126 = $196 (this is the amount that can be deducted).

3. **Total Deductions**:
   - Standard Deduction: $177
   - Excess Shelter Deduction: $196
   - Total Deductions: $177 + $196 = $373

4. **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Gross earned income: $0
   - Deduction: $0 (20% of $0)

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - Household size: 1 (since there is 1 individual)
   - Standard deduction for household size 1: $177

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported)

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no child support reported)

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs: $947 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $1,269
   - 50% of net income after deductions: 
     - Net income: $1,210
     - 50% of $1,210 = $605
   - Excess shelter costs: $1,269 - $605 = $664 (this amount is eligible for deduction)
   - However, the maximum shelter deduction allowed is $597.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
   - Gross Income: $1,615
   - Total Deductions: $177 (standard) + $0 (earned income) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $597 (shelter deduction) = $974
   - Net Monthly Income: $1,615 - $974 = $641

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 1**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
   - 30% of $641 = $192.30 (rounded to $192)
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**: 
   - Maximum allotment - 30% of net income = $250 - $192 = $58

1. **Determine Gross Monthly Income**: 
   - Total gross income: $813

2. **Determine Net Monthly Income**: 
   - Total net income: $621

3. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 4, the standard deduction is $184.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
   - **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
     - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities): $322 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $644
     - 50% of net income: 50% of $621 = $310.5
     - Excess shelter costs: $644 - $310.5 = $333.5 (this amount is greater than $0, so it can be deducted).
     - However, the maximum shelter deduction is $597, so we will use the full amount of $333.5.

4. **Calculate Net Monthly Income After Deductions**:
   - Net income after deductions = Gross income - (20% earned income deduction + standard deduction + dependent care deduction + child support + excess shelter costs)
   - Net income after deductions = $813 - ($0 + $184 + $0 + $0 + $333.5) = $813 - $517.5 = $295.5

5. **Calculate SNAP Benefits**:
   - The household's monthly allotment is equal to the maximum SNAP allotment for the household size reduced by 30% of the household's net monthly income.
   - Maximum Monthly Allotment for a household of 4: $835
   - 30% of net monthly income: 30% of $295.5 = $88.65
   - Final SNAP benefit = Maximum allotment - 30% of net income = $835 - $88.65 = $746.35

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - Since SNAP benefits are rounded down to the nearest dollar, the final calculated benefit is $746.

- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
  - 20% of $76 = $15.20
- **Standard Deduction**: 
  - For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**:

     - For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
   - **Medical Expenses**: 
     - Since there are no reported medical expenses, this deduction is $0.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
     - $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
   - **Child Support Payments**: 
     - $0 (no child support payments reported).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
     - Since the household spends $0 on shelter, this deduction is $0.

4. **Total Deductions**:
   - Total Deductions = Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction + Medical Expenses + Dependent Care + Child Support + Excess Shelter Costs
   - Total Deductions = $522.80 + $178 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $0 = $700.80

5. **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
   - Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - Total Deductions
   - Net Monthly Income = $2614 - $700.80 = $1913.20

6. **Final Calculation of SNAP Benefits**:
   - Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person: $250

1. **Gross Monthly Income**: $1,909
2. **Net Monthly Income**: $1,732

### Deductions:
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support reported).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total shelter costs: $676
  - 50% of net income after deductions: 50% of $1,732 = $866
  - Since $676 is less than $866, there are no excess shelter costs to deduct.

### Total Deductions:
- Total deductions = Standard Deduction + Earned Income Deduction + Dependent Care Deduction + Child Support Deduction + Excess Shelter Costs
- Total deductions = $177 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $0 = $177

### Net Income Calculation:
- Net Income after deductions = Net Monthly Income - Total Deductions
- Net Income after deductions = $1,732 - $177 = $1,555

### SNAP Benefit Calculation:
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person: $250
- 30% of the net income after deductions: 30% of $1,555 = $466.50
- SNAP benefit = Maximum Monthly Allotment - 30% of net income
- SNAP benefit = $250 - $466.50 = Negative value, which means the household is not eligible for benefits.

Since the calculated benefit is negative, the household is not eligible for SNAP benefits.

### Step 1: Determine Gross and Net Income
- **Gross Income**: $978
- **Net Income**: $801

### Step 2: Apply Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 2, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $322 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $644.
   - Since the household's net income is $801, 50% of the net income is $400.
   - Excess shelter costs = $644 - $400 = $244.
   - The maximum shelter deduction is $597, so the household can claim the full excess shelter costs of $244.

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
  - Net Income: $801
  - Deductions: $177 (standard) + $0 (earned income) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $244 (excess shelter) = $421
  - Adjusted Net Income: $801 - $421 = $380

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size of 2**: $459
- **30% of Adjusted Net Income**: 
  - 30% of $380 = $114
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
  - SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $459 - $114 = $345

### Step 5: Resource Limits
- The household is categorically eligible for SNAP through TANF, so there is no limit on resources.

### Step 6: Certification Period
- The certification period for SNAP is typically 12 months for households that are categorically eligible.

   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - **Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Medical Expenses**: Since there is one person with a disability, we can consider medical expenses. However, no medical expenses were reported, so this deduction is $0.
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
     - Total Shelter Costs: $322
     - 50% of Net Income: 50% of $252 = $126

     - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities): $331 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $653
     - 50% of net income: 50% of $612 = $306
     - Excess shelter costs: $653 - $306 = $347 (this amount is greater than the maximum shelter deduction of $597, so we will use $597).

4. **Calculate Net Monthly Income**:
   - Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - Deductions
   - Deductions = 20% Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction + Dependent Care Deduction + Child Support + Excess Shelter Costs
   - Deductions = $0 + $184 + $0 + $0 + $597 = $781
   - Net Monthly Income = $813 - $781 = $32

5. **Calculate SNAP Benefits**:
   - Maximum Monthly Allotment for a household of 4: $835
   - 30% of Net Monthly Income: 30% of $32 = $9.60 (rounded to $10)
   - SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $835 - $10 = $825

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Earned income = $0
   - 20% of $0 = $0

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - Household size = 3
   - Standard deduction for household size 3 = $177

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - Dependent care expenses = $0 (not applicable)

4. **Child Support Payments**: 
   - Child support = $0 (not applicable)

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs = $657 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $979
   - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of ($1525 - $0 - $177) = 50% of $1348 = $674
   - Excess shelter costs = $979 - $674 = $305 (this amount can be deducted)

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- Gross monthly income = $1702
- Total deductions = $0 (earned income) + $177 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $305 (excess shelter) = $482
- Net monthly income = $1702 - $482 = $1220

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for a household of 3 = $658
- 30% of net monthly income = 30% of $1220 = $366
- SNAP benefit = Maximum allotment - 30% of net income = $658 - $366 = $292

1. **Determine Gross Monthly Income**: 
   - Total gross income: $665

2. **Calculate Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 3, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
   - **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
     - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities): $322 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $644
     - 50% of net income after deductions: 50% of $410 = $205
     - Excess shelter costs: $644 - $205 = $439 (this amount can be deducted).
     - However, the maximum shelter deduction allowed is $597, but since the excess is $439, we will use that amount.

3. **Calculate Net Monthly Income**:
   - Gross Income: $665
   - Total Deductions: $0 (earned income) + $177 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $439 (excess shelter) = $616

### Total Deductions
- Total deductions = 20% Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction + Dependent Care Deduction + Legally Owed Child Support + Excess Shelter Costs
- Total deductions = $0 + $177 + $0 + $0 + $597 = $774.

### Net Monthly Income Calculation
- Net Monthly Income = Gross Monthly Income - Total Deductions
- Net Monthly Income = $521 - $774 = -$253 (since net income cannot be negative, we will consider it as $0 for the purpose of calculating benefits).

1. **Gross Income**: $1,766
2. **Net Income**: $1,236

### Deductions
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
  - 20% of $1,766 = $353.20
- **Standard Deduction**: 
  - For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
  - Total shelter costs: $15
  - Since the household is homeless, we will not apply excess shelter costs.

### Calculation of Net Monthly Income
Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - (Earned Income Deduction + Standard Deduction + Dependent Care Deduction + Child Support Payments)
- Net Monthly Income = $1,766 - ($353.20 + $178 + $0 + $0) 
- Net Monthly Income = $1,766 - $531.20 = $1,234.80

### SNAP Allotment Calculation
1. **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 Person**: $250
2. **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
   - 30% of $1,234.80 = $370.44
3. **Final SNAP Allotment**: 
   - Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income = $250 - $370.44
   - Since the result is negative, the household is not eligible for benefits.

### Final Calculated Benefit
Since the calculated benefit is negative, the household is not eligible for SNAP benefits.

1. **Household Composition**: 
   - 1 individual in the household.
   - 1 person over 60 years old.
   - 0 people with a disability.
   - Household is homeless.

2. **Income**:
   - Total gross income: $0

   - **Dependent care deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - **Legally owed child support payments**: $0.
   - **Medical expenses**: Since there are no medical expenses reported, this deduction is $0.
   - **Excess shelter costs**: The household spends $1382 on shelter expenses and $322 on utilities, totaling $1704. Since the net income is $0, the excess shelter cost is calculated as follows:
     - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of $0 = $0.
     - Therefore, the excess shelter cost is $1704 - $0 = $1704.

4. **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:

   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Medical Expenses**: Since there are no out-of-pocket medical expenses reported, this deduction is $0.
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: The household spends $944 on shelter expenses and $322 on utilities. The total shelter costs are $944 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $1,266.

   - No one over 60 or with a disability.
   - The household is homeless.

2. **Income**:
   - Total gross income: $0
   - Total net income: $0

3. **Deductions**:
   - 20% deduction on earned income: Since the earned income is $0, the deduction is $0.
   - Standard deduction: For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $167 (as of FY 2022).
   - Dependent care deduction: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - Legally owed child support payments: $0.
   - Excess shelter costs: Not applicable since the household spends $0 on shelter.

4. **Net Income Calculation**:
   - Gross income: $0
   - Deductions: $0 (20% of earned income) + $167 (standard deduction) = $167
   - Net income: $0 - $167 = $0 (Net income cannot be negative, so it is considered $0).

5. **Maximum Monthly Allotment**:
   - For a household of 1, the maximum monthly allotment is $250.

### Step 1: Determine Gross and Net Income
- **Gross Income**: $1215
- **Net Income**: $0

### Step 2: Apply Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**:
   - Earned Income: $1215
   - 20% of $1215 = $243
   - Adjusted Gross Income after deduction: $1215 - $243 = $972

2. **Standard Deduction**:
   - Household Size: 1 (Standard Deduction for 1-2 people is $177)
   - Adjusted Gross Income after standard deduction: $972 - $177 = $795

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported)

4. **Child Support Deduction**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no child support payments reported)

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**:
   - Total Shelter Costs: $1307 (includes rent and utilities)
   - Utilities: $322
   - Total Shelter Costs (Rent + Utilities): $1307 + $322 = $1629
   - 50% of Net Income after deductions: 50% of $795 = $397.50
   - Excess Shelter Costs: $1629 - $397.50 = $1231.50
   - Since the household is homeless, they qualify for the homeless shelter deduction of $159.73.

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- Net Monthly Income after all deductions:
  - $795 (after standard deduction) - $159.73 (homeless shelter deduction) = $635.27

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 30% of $635.27 = $190.58
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
  - $250 (Maximum Allotment) - $190.58 = $59.42

### Step 5: Resource Limits
- Total Liquid Assets: $28951.00
- Since the household is not categorically eligible and has liquid resources exceeding the limit of $2,500 for households without a member over 60 or disabled, they are ineligible for SNAP.

### Conclusion
The household is ineligible for SNAP benefits due to exceeding the resource limit.

1. **Household Information**:
   - Household Size: 1
   - Age: 1 person over 60
   - Disability: 0
   - Homeless: Yes
   - Gross Income: $861
   - Net Income: $684

2. **Deductions**:

   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - **Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support payments).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: The household spends $81 on shelter. Since this is less than half of the net income ($684 / 2 = $342), there are no excess shelter costs to deduct.

3. **Calculating Net Monthly Income**:
   - Starting with the net income: $684
   - Subtract the standard deduction: $684 - $177 = $507

4. **Calculating SNAP Benefits**:
   - The maximum monthly allotment for a household of 1 is $250.
   - Calculate 30% of the adjusted net income: 30% of $507 = $152.10 (rounded to $152).
   - Subtract this from the maximum allotment: $250 - $152 = $98.

1. **Gross Monthly Income**: $0
2. **Net Monthly Income**: $0

### Deductions:
- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the gross income is $0, the deduction is also $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $193 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support reported).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: The household spends $935 on shelter. Since the net income is $0, we calculate the excess shelter costs:
  - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of $0 = $0.
  - Therefore, the excess shelter cost is $935 - $0 = $935.

### Total Deductions:
- Standard Deduction: $193
- Earned Income Deduction: $0
- Dependent Care Deduction: $0
- Legally Owed Child Support: $0
- Excess Shelter Costs: $935

Total Deductions = $193 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $935 = $1,128.

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**:
   - Earned Income: $1,046
   - 20% Deduction: $1,046 * 0.20 = $209.20

2. **Standard Deduction**:
   - Since the household size is 1, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**:
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Child Support Payments**:
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**:
   - Total Shelter Expenses: $856
   - 50% of Net Income after deductions:
     - Net Income: $2,177
     - 50% of Net Income: $2,177 * 0.50 = $1,088.50
   - Since $856 (shelter costs) is less than $1,088.50, there are no excess shelter costs to deduct.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
   - Gross Income: $2,563
   - Total Deductions:
     - Earned Income Deduction: $209.20
     - Standard Deduction: $177
     - Dependent Care Deduction: $0
     - Child Support Deduction: $0
   - Total Deductions: $209.20 + $177 = $386.20
   - Net Monthly Income: $2,563 - $386.20 = $2,176.80 (rounded to $2,177 for consistency with reported net income)

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 Person**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**:
   - 30% of $2,177: $2,177 * 0.30 = $653.10 (rounded to $653)
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
   - SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income
   - SNAP Benefit = $250 - $653 = Negative value, which means the household is not eligible for benefits.

### Final Assessment
Since the calculated SNAP benefit is negative, the household is not eligible for SNAP benefits.

### Step 1: Determine Gross and Net Income
- **Gross Income**: $1,154
- **Net Income**: $965

### Step 2: Apply Deductions
1. **20% Deduction on Earned Income**: 
   - Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household of 1, the standard deduction for FY 2022 is $178.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs: $500
   - 50% of net income after deductions: 50% of $965 = $482.50
   - Excess shelter costs: $500 - $482.50 = $17.50 (this is the amount that can be deducted).

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
  - Net Income: $965
  - Minus Standard Deduction: $965 - $178 = $787
  - Minus Excess Shelter Costs: $787 - $17.50 = $769.50

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
  - 30% of $769.50 = $230.85

- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 Person**: 
  - $250

- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
  - Maximum Monthly Allotment - 30% of Net Monthly Income: 
  - $250 - $230.85 = $19.15

1. **Household Composition**: 
   - 1 individual in the household.
   - No one over 60 or with a disability.

2. **Income**:
   - Total gross income: $0
   - Total net income: $0

3. **Deductions**:
   - 20% deduction on earned income: 20% of $0 = $0
   - Standard deduction: The standard deduction for a household of 1 is $178 (as of FY 2022).
   - Dependent care deduction: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - Legally owed child support payments: $0.
   - Excess shelter costs: $0 (no shelter costs).

4. **Net Income Calculation**:
   - Gross income: $0
   - Deductions: $0 (20% of earned income) + $178 (standard deduction) = $178
   - Net income: $0 - $178 = $0 (Net income cannot be negative, so it is considered $0).

5. **Maximum Monthly Allotment**:
   - For a household of 1, the maximum monthly allotment is $250.

6. **Final Benefit Calculation**:
   - The monthly allotment is calculated as the maximum allotment minus 30% of the net income.

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 1-2, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $322 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $644.
   - The household's net income after other deductions = $684.
   - 50% of net income = $684 * 0.5 = $342.
   - Excess shelter costs = $644 - $342 = $302 (this is the amount that can be deducted).

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income**: 
   - Starting with the net income of $684.
   - Deductions: 
     - Standard Deduction: $177
     - Excess Shelter Deduction: $302
   - Total deductions = $177 + $302 = $479.
   - Net Monthly Income after deductions = $684 - $479 = $205.

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefit
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size of 1**: $250.
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
   - 30% of $205 = $61.50.
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**: 
   - Maximum allotment - 30% of net income = $250 - $61.50 = $188.50.
   - Since benefits are rounded down to the nearest dollar, the final benefit is $188.

1. **Household Information**:
   - Household Size: 1
   - Age of Household Member: 1 person over 60
   - Homeless: Yes
   - Total Gross Income: $1200
   - Total Net Income: $188

2. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
   - **Child Support Deduction**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
     - Total Shelter Costs: $1346 (includes rent and utilities).
     - Total Utilities: $322.
     - Total Shelter Costs (Rent + Utilities): $1346 + $322 = $1668.
     - Net Income after deductions: $188.
     - 50% of Net Income: $188 / 2 = $94.
     - Excess Shelter Costs: $1346 - $94 = $1252 (this amount exceeds the maximum shelter deduction of $597).
     - Therefore, the shelter deduction will be capped at $597.

3. **Total Deductions**:
   - Total Deductions = Standard Deduction + Shelter Deduction
   - Total Deductions = $177 + $597 = $774.

4. **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
   - Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - Total Deductions
   - Net Monthly Income = $1200 - $774 = $426.

5. **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
   - Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person: $250.
   - 30% of Net Monthly Income: 30% of $426 = $127.80.
   - Final SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Net Income
   - Final SNAP Benefit = $250 - $127.80 = $122.20.

### Step 1: Determine Gross and Net Income
- **Gross Income**: $841
- **Net Income**: $664

### Step 2: Apply Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 1-2, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $322 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $644.
   - Since the household's net income after deductions is $664, we calculate 50% of that: $664 * 0.5 = $332.
   - Excess shelter costs = $644 - $332 = $312.
   - Since this amount exceeds the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we can deduct the full amount of $312.

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
  - Net Income: $664
  - Deductions: $177 (standard) + $0 (earned income) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $312 (excess shelter) = $489
  - Adjusted Net Income: $664 - $489 = $175

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person**: $250
- **30% of Adjusted Net Income**: 
  - 30% of $175 = $52.50 (rounded to $53).
  
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
  - Maximum Monthly Allotment: $250
  - Subtract 30% of Adjusted Net Income: $250 - $53 = $197

### Final Calculation
The final calculated benefit for this household is:

   - 1 individual in the household
   - 1 person over 60 years old
   - 0 people with a disability
   - Household is not categorically eligible through TANF
   - Household is homeless

2. **Income**:
   - Gross Income: $1,229
   - Net Income: $548

3. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the household has no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
     - Total Shelter Costs: $1,030 (includes rent and utilities).
     - Total Shelter Costs after deductions: $1,030 - (50% of Net Income) = $1,030 - (0.5 * $548) = $1,030 - $274 = $756.
     - Since the household is homeless, we will consider the full amount of shelter costs.

4. **Calculating Net Monthly Income**:
   - Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - Deductions
   - Deductions = 0 (earned income) + 178 (standard deduction) + 0 (dependent care) + 0 (child support) + 756 (excess shelter costs) = $934.
   - Net Monthly Income = $1,229 - $934 = $295.

   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Shelter Deduction**: The household's total shelter costs are $805. We need to determine if they can claim the excess shelter deduction:
     - 50% of net income: 50% of $882 = $441.
     - Excess shelter costs: $805 (total shelter costs) - $441 (50% of net income) = $364 (this is the excess shelter cost).
     - Since the excess shelter cost is less than the maximum shelter deduction of $597, the household can claim the full excess shelter cost of $364.

### Step 1: Determine Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Gross income: $915
   - Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - Household size: 1
   - Standard deduction for household size 1: $177

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported)

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no child support received)

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs: $822 (includes rent and utilities)
   - Total utilities: $322
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities): $822 + $322 = $1,144
   - Net income after deductions: $285
   - 50% of net income: $285 * 0.5 = $142.5
   - Excess shelter costs: $1,144 - $142.5 = $1,001.5 (this amount is greater than the maximum shelter deduction of $597, so we will use $597)

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- Net income before deductions: $285
- Total deductions:
  - Standard deduction: $177
  - Excess shelter deduction: $597
- Total deductions: $177 + $597 = $774

### Step 3: Calculate Adjusted Net Income
- Adjusted net income: $285 - $774 = -$489 (Since this is negative, we will consider it as $0 for the purpose of calculating benefits)

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person: $250
- 30% of adjusted net income: 30% of $0 = $0
- Final SNAP benefit calculation: $250 - $0 = $250

### Step 1: Determine Household Size and Composition
- **Household Size**: 1
- **Age of Household Member**: 1 member over 60 years old
- **Disability**: 0 members with a disability
- **Categorical Eligibility**: Not categorically eligible through TANF

### Step 2: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Gross Income: $861
   - Earned Income: $0
   - Deduction: 20% of $0 = $0

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - Household Size: 1
   - Standard Deduction for Household Size 1: $177

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported)

4. **Legally Owed Child Support**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no child support received)

5. **Medical Expenses Deduction**: 
   - Since there is one member over 60, we can deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses over $35. However, no medical expenses were reported.

6. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total Shelter Costs: $539 (rent) + $322 (utilities) = $861
   - 50% of Net Income: 50% of $487 = $243.5
   - Excess Shelter Costs: $861 - $243.5 = $617.5 (this amount can be deducted)

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Income Calculation**:
   - Gross Income: $861
   - Total Deductions: $0 (earned income) + $177 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $0 (medical) + $617.5 (excess shelter) = $794.5
   - Net Monthly Income: $861 - $794.5 = $66.5

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 1**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 30% of $66.5 = $19.95
- **Final SNAP Allotment Calculation**: 
   - Maximum Allotment: $250
   - Subtract 30% of Net Income: $250 - $19.95 = $230.05
   - Final SNAP Benefit: $230 (rounded down)

### Step 5: Resource Limits
- **Total Assets**: $0 (no countable resources)
- **Resource Limit for Household with a member over 60**: $3,750 (the household is eligible as they are below this limit)

### Step 6: Certification Period
- The certification period for SNAP is typically 12 months for households with elderly or disabled members.

### Final Calculation

### Step 1: Calculate Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Gross earned income: $0
   - 20% deduction: $0 * 20% = $0

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - Household size: 1
   - Standard deduction for household size 1: $177

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported)

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - Amount: $0 (no child support received)

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs: $231
   - 50% of net income after deductions: 
     - Net income: $684
     - 50% of $684 = $342
   - Since $231 (shelter costs) is less than $342, there are no excess shelter costs to deduct.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Total Deductions**: 
  - Earned income deduction: $0
  - Standard deduction: $177
  - Dependent care deduction: $0
  - Child support deduction: $0
  - Excess shelter costs: $0
- **Total deductions**: $0 + $177 + $0 + $0 + $0 = $177

- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
  - Gross monthly income: $861
  - Total deductions: $177
  - Net monthly income: $861 - $177 = $684

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 1**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
  - 30% of $684 = $205.20
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
  - Maximum allotment: $250
  - Subtract 30% of net income: $250 - $205.20 = $44.80
  - Since benefits are rounded down to the nearest whole dollar, the final benefit amount is $44.

     - 50% of net income: $174 * 50% = $87
   - Excess shelter costs: $1,144 - $87 = $1,057 (this amount is greater than $0, so it can be deducted)

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Income Calculation**:
   - Gross income: $841
   - Total deductions: $0 (earned income) + $177 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $1,057 (excess shelter) = $1,234

- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the gross income is $0, the deduction is also $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**:

    - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of $0 = $0.
    - Therefore, the excess shelter costs = $644 - $0 = $644.

### Net Income Calculation:
- **Net Income**: $0 (gross income) - $0 (earned income deduction) - $178 (standard deduction) - $0 (dependent care deduction) - $0 (child support) = -$178.
- Since the net income cannot be negative, we consider it as $0 for the purpose of calculating benefits.

   - Amount received: $0
   - This deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities): $447 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $769
   - 50% of net income after deductions: 
     - Net income: $995
     - 50% of $995 = $497.50
   - Excess shelter costs: $769 - $497.50 = $271.50
   - Since the excess shelter costs are more than $0, we can deduct this amount.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
  - Gross income: $1,172
  - Deductions:
    - 20% Earned Income Deduction: $0
    - Standard Deduction: $177
    - Dependent Care Deduction: $0
    - Legally Owed Child Support Payments: $0
    - Excess Shelter Costs: $271.50
  - Total deductions: $177 + $271.50 = $448.50
  - Net Monthly Income: $1,172 - $448.50 = $723.50

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 1**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
  - 30% of $723.50 = $217.05
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
  - Maximum allotment: $250
  - Subtract 30% of net income: $250 - $217.05 = $32.95
- The final calculated benefit is rounded down to the nearest dollar: $32.

### Step 4: Resource Limits
- The household has no countable resources (liquid assets, vehicles, etc.), which is below the resource limit of $2,500 for households without a member who is age 60 or older or disabled.

### Final Calculation
- The final calculated benefit for the household is:

- **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since the gross income is $0, the deduction is also $0.
- **Standard Deduction**: For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $178 (as of FY 2022).
- **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses reported).
- **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support reported).
- **Excess Shelter Costs**: The household spends $1,251 on shelter expenses. Since the net income is $0, we calculate the excess shelter costs:
  - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of $0 = $0.
  - Therefore, the excess shelter costs = $1,251 - $0 = $1,251.

### Total Deductions:
- Total deductions = Standard Deduction + 20% Earned Income Deduction + Dependent Care Deduction + Legally Owed Child Support + Excess Shelter Costs
- Total deductions = $178 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $1,251 = $1,429.

### Step 1: Determine Gross and Net Income
- **Gross Income**: $861
- **Net Income**: $684

### Step 2: Apply Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 1 to 2, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $322 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $644.
   - Since the household's net income after deductions is $684, we calculate 50% of that: 
     - 50% of $684 = $342.
   - Excess shelter costs = $644 - $342 = $302.
   - Since this is more than $0, we can deduct the full amount of $302.

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
  - Net Income: $684
  - Deductions: 
    - Standard Deduction: $177
    - Excess Shelter Deduction: $302
  - Total Deductions: $177 + $302 = $479
  - Adjusted Net Income: $684 - $479 = $205

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person**: $250
- **30% of Adjusted Net Income**: 
  - 30% of $205 = $61.50 (rounded to $61).
  
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
  - Maximum Allotment: $250

1. **Household Information**:
   - Household Size: 1
   - Age: 1 person over 60
   - Homeless: Yes
   - Total Gross Income: $841
   - Total Net Income: $664

2. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**:

   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Dependent Care Deduction**: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: $0 (no child support received).
   - **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
     - Total Shelter Expenses: $1,122 (includes rent and utilities).
     - Total Utilities: $322.
     - Total Shelter Costs (Rent + Utilities): $1,122 + $322 = $1,444.
     - Net Income after other deductions: $444.
     - 50% of Net Income: $444 * 0.5 = $222.
     - Excess Shelter Costs: $1,444 - $222 = $1,222 (this amount is greater than the maximum shelter deduction of $597, so we will use $597).

3. **Calculating Net Monthly Income**:
   - Net Income: $444
   - Total Deductions: $0 (earned income) + $177 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $597 (excess shelter costs) = $774.
   - Adjusted Net Income: $444 - $774 = $0 (since we cannot have negative income, we will consider it as $0).

4. **Calculating SNAP Benefits**:
   - Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person: $250.
   - 30% of Adjusted Net Income: 30% of $0 = $0.

1. **Household Information**:
   - Household Size: 1
   - Gross Income: $1,316
   - Net Income: $1,139
   - Shelter Expenses: $445 (rent) + $72 (utilities) = $517 total shelter costs
   - No dependent care expenses, no child support payments, and no other income sources.

2. **Deductions**:
   - **20% Earned Income Deduction**: Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.
   - **Standard Deduction**: For a household size of 1, the standard deduction is $177.
   - **Shelter Deduction**: The household's total shelter costs are $517. We need to determine if there are excess shelter costs:
     - 50% of the net income: 50% of $1,139 = $569.5
     - Since the total shelter costs ($517) are less than 50% of the net income ($569.5), the household can claim the full amount of $517 as a shelter deduction.

3. **Calculating Net Monthly Income**:
   - Net Income: $1,139
   - Deductions:
     - Standard Deduction: $177
     - Shelter Deduction: $517
   - Total Deductions: $177 + $517 = $694
   - Adjusted Net Income: $1,139 - $694 = $445

4. **Calculating SNAP Benefits**:
   - Maximum Monthly Allotment for 1 person: $250
   - 30% of Adjusted Net Income: 30% of $445 = $133.5
   - SNAP Benefit Calculation: $250 - $133.5 = $116.5
   - Since benefits are rounded down to the nearest whole dollar, the final calculated benefit is $116.

5. **Resource Limits**:
   - The household has total assets of $0, which is below the resource limit of $2,500 for households without a member over 60 or disabled.

6. **Certification Period**:
   - The certification period for SNAP is typically 12 months for most households, but it can vary based on state policies and household circumstances.

     - 50% of $463 = $231.50
   - Excess shelter costs: $855 - $231.50 = $623.50
   - Since the excess shelter costs exceed the maximum shelter deduction of $597, we will use $597 for the deduction.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Income Calculation**:
   - Gross income: $841
   - Total deductions: $177 (standard) + $0 (earned income) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $597 (excess shelter) = $974
   - Net monthly income: $841 - $974 = -$133 (but net income cannot be negative, so we consider it as $0 for SNAP calculations).

### Step 3: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size 1**: $250
- **30% of Net Monthly Income**: 
   - 30% of $0 = $0
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
   - Maximum allotment: $250
   - Final benefit: $250 - $0 = $250

1. **Household Composition**: 
   - 1 individual in the household.
   - No one over 60 or with a disability.
   - Not categorically eligible through TANF.

2. **Income**:
   - Gross Income: $0
   - Net Income: $0

3. **Deductions**:
   - 20% deduction on earned income: 20% of $0 = $0
   - Standard deduction: For a household of 1, the standard deduction is $193 (as of FY 2022).
   - Dependent care deduction: $0 (no dependent care expenses).
   - Legally owed child support payments: $0.
   - Medical expenses: $0 (no one over 60 or with a disability).
   - Shelter costs: Total shelter costs = Rent ($322) + Utilities ($0) = $322.

4. **Calculating Net Monthly Income**:
   - Gross Income: $0
   - Deductions: $0 (earned income deduction) + $193 (standard deduction) = $193
   - Net Monthly Income = Gross Income - Deductions = $0 - $193 = -$193 (but we consider it as $0 for SNAP calculations).

5. **Shelter Deduction**:
   - Since the net income is $0, we calculate excess shelter costs.
   - Excess shelter costs = Total shelter costs - 50% of net income = $322 - (50% of $0) = $322.
   - The full amount of $322 can be deducted since the household is not subject to a capped shelter expense.

6. **Final Net Income Calculation**:
   - Net Monthly Income after shelter deduction = $0 - $322 = -$322 (but we consider it as $0 for SNAP calculations).

7. **Maximum Monthly Allotment**:
   - For a household of 1, the maximum monthly allotment is $250.

8. **Final Benefit Calculation**:
   - SNAP benefit = Maximum Monthly Allotment - 30% of Net Monthly Income.
   - 30% of Net Monthly Income = 30% of $0 = $0.
   - Final SNAP benefit = $250 - $0 = $250.

### Step 1: Determine Gross and Net Income
- **Gross Income**: $1,212
- **Net Income**: $1,035

### Step 2: Apply Deductions
1. **20% Earned Income Deduction**: 
   - Since there is no earned income, this deduction is $0.

2. **Standard Deduction**: 
   - For a household size of 2, the standard deduction is $177.

3. **Dependent Care Deduction**: 
   - The household spends $0 on dependent care, so this deduction is $0.

4. **Legally Owed Child Support Payments**: 
   - The household receives $0 in child support, so this deduction is $0.

5. **Excess Shelter Costs**: 
   - Total shelter costs (rent + utilities) = $357 (shelter) + $322 (utilities) = $679.
   - 50% of net income after deductions = 50% of $1,035 = $517.5.
   - Excess shelter costs = $679 - $517.5 = $161.5 (this amount can be deducted).

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Income
- **Net Monthly Income Calculation**:
   - Net Income: $1,035
   - Deductions: $0 (earned income) + $177 (standard deduction) + $0 (dependent care) + $0 (child support) + $161.5 (excess shelter) = $338.5
   - Adjusted Net Income: $1,035 - $338.5 = $696.5

### Step 4: Calculate SNAP Benefits
- **Maximum Monthly Allotment for Household Size of 2**: $459
- **30% of Adjusted Net Income**: 
   - 30% of $696.5 = $208.95
- **Final SNAP Benefit Calculation**:
   - SNAP Benefit = Maximum Allotment - 30% of Adjusted Net Income = $459 - $208.95 = $250.05
   - Since benefits are rounded down to the nearest dollar, the final calculated benefit is $250.

### Step 5: Resource Limits
- The household has no countable resources (liquid assets, vehicles, etc.), which is below the resource limit of $2,500 for households without a member over 60 or disabled.

### Step 6: Certification Period
- The certification period for SNAP is typically 12 months for households without special circumstances. 

### Final Calculation
The final calculated benefit for this household is:
